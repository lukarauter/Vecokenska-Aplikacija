# Vecokenska Aplikacija
 App for writing, loading and saving data in XML file |
 example : an app that could be used for company that sells cars
 In app you can choose 4 main options:
 - add
 - edit
 - delete
 - choose a specified option that gives you answer on specified result
   
App saves data on closing and puts it back into table after opening it, it is all saved in XML file
On add and edit button the new forms open and on fourth option it also opens it in new form
the app also have a failsafe against user putting for example Letnik can not be more than four numbers and Znamka can not use numbers for input by the user
